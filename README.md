[00:00.67] Oh, you got power, superpowers
[00:08.76] Do you even know how to wield them?
[00:12.76] All God's children are special
[00:18.51] But not like you, no, not like you
[00:35.51] 
[00:24.64] You're just like a flower (flower)
[00:29.12] You're ever-giving, that's a given

[00:42.61] But not like you, no, not like you
[00:59.61] 
[00:50.25] (Lift it, lift it, lift it)
[00:51.08] Lift your head to the sky (to the sky, oh, sky, sky)
[01:02.43] (Lift it, lift it, lift it, lift it)
[01:20.43] 
[01:12.79] Mm, it's crazy to say this, but you're the greatest (you are the greatest)
[01:21.75] Can't explain it (oh)
[01:24.56] I know that you know the truth
[01:27.81] They can't deny you, yeah, they can't deny you, it's true
[01:56.31]

[01:48.67] And let me just say this
[01:53.19] Oh, yeah, you're the main character now
[01:58.51] You're the main character now
[02:13.01] 
[02:02.20] (Lift it, lift it, lift it)
[02:02.82] Lift your head to the sky (to the sky, oh, sky, sky)
