Do you feel like you're a genuine person

Or people that like

And power
And one of man's greatest superpowers
Is a gun

Told that bitch to shave her pussy, looking like it went through Chemo
Manager said not to say that, give a fuck about we he know

Mona Lisa painting worth of fucking money on my left wrist
Milly on the fit, spent at least 400 on the necklace
Niggas running up to my fucking crib, all this flexing
Slapped em wit the stick, hit em wit the will Smith & Wesson

How you be barking up the oak but never show ya tail
Don't be a bitch, like the kids do, show and tell
