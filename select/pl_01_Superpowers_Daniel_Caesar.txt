Oh, you got power
Superpowers
Do you even know
how to wield them?
All God's children are special
But not like you
No, not like you
You're just like a flower
Ever given that's a given
All God's children are special
But not like you
No, not like you
Lift your head to the sky
(Sky)
Lift it
Lift it
Lift it
Lift it
Crazy to say this
But you're the greatest
(You're the greatest)
Can't explain it
I know that you know the truth
They can't deny you
Yeah, they can't deny you
It's true
Yeah, remember Vegas
You come a long way, kid
And let me just say this
You're the main character now
You're the main character now
Lift it
Lift it
Lift it
Lift it
Lift your head to the sky
You're the main character now
You're the main character now
