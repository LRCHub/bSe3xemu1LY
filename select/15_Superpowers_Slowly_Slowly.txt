Alright so you get a superpower
And you choose to fly
Would it get lonely by yourself
Way up high?
I imagine all the noise from all the winds would annoy you
And carrying the outfits you need to change into
Freeze on the ocean
Cook under the sun
Your body was just made to run

Okay new superpower
You want to disappear
Oh now you're invisible at will
My dear that just happens to be my greatest fear
It might be nice being nude with the world as your bedroom
Stealing things and messing with your friends I'd assume
But wouldn't it be nice to disappear with someone else
To not have it all confined to your creepy little self?

Change your superpower
Okay you wanna stop time
All your family, friends & strangers
Stuck like frozen mimes
And you could pick pocket their change
Give them haircuts that they'll hate
But do you think all of that power just maybe might just turn sour?
Where would you find satisfaction?
All you wanted
Now you have it
Never had to work for it
And everyone would question it

New superpower
You're never gonna die
You wanna watch all your friends and family disappear over time?
Oh please
Oh this one is a no brainer
You'd lose all context with no saviour
It's imminent death that keeps you at your best
You need a fire underneath you
Or nothings gonna teach you
A reason to open your eyes

Look I don't want a superpower
I just wanna survive
I want to feel present when you talk
Just feel alive
I'm gonna do what I want and not for the coin
But because if I don't
Then what's the point?
Money and power just won't scratch the itch
So maybe we don't have to wish
You don't need superpowers
